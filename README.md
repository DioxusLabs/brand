# Dioxus Brand Resources

This repository contains varioues brand assets for Dioxus.

## Logos

You can find the dioxus logo in the `logos` folder. You may use the logo for your own projects, but please do not use it for commercial purposes.

Please keep the logo intact. SVG is always preferred as it will infinitely scale with no quality loss.


## Contributing

This repository is rather light in substance compared to the other Dioxus repositories. If you want to help improve our brand assets, please reach out and we can open our Figma file for you to work on.

We use keyshape for animations and export them to SVG.




<!-- I like posthog's brand page! Let's borrow what inspiration we can from them. -->
